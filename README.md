# Quotes-App

### A short and simple DOM application to understand the basics of correlation between HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

A simple DOM application using APIs. The application allows to get new quotes with the author name. In addition to that we can also post the readily available quote on our Twitter account just by one click. It is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The main focus is on understanding how these three work together. An ample amount of comments are used throughout the code. 


## Getting Started

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the website.
* Click the "New Quotes" button to get a new quote.
* Click on the Twitter logo to be redirected to your Twitter account and get a readily available post (make sure you are logged in to your         Twitter account beforehand.)
* Explore the code by opening the file in a text editor and following the comments.
